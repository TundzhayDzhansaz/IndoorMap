#Bulding Roads
We need to develop more understandable building scheme in this situation. Because hallways not much understandable and not usefull (technically every room should has a arriving path but in this model we only have one path), furthermore we should add here flat number (If we can make a 3D model that's will be amazing). Where is the rooms? in first flat or second flat. If we are starting our rote in first flat and we want to arrive second flat room. We have to use stairs for that. ETC.
